<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zinc Oxide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Process (America Method)</li><li>Indirect Process (French Method)</li><li>Wet Chemical Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The zinc oxide market primarily consists of three production methods: the Direct Process (often referred to as the American Method), the Indirect Process (or French Method), and the Wet Chemical Process. The Direct Process involves roasting zinc ore with oxygen, yielding zinc vapor that is oxidized. The Indirect Process melts zinc and oxidizes the vapor to form zinc oxide, while the Wet Chemical Process utilizes chemical reactions in solution to synthesize zinc oxide. Each method offers distinct advantages in purity, production efficiency, and application suitability.</p></p>
