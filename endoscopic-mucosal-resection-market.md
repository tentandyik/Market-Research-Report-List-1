<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endoscopic Mucosal Resection Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lift-and-Cut Technique</li><li>Suck-and-Cut Technique</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) market is segmented into two primary techniques: the Lift-and-Cut and the Suck-and-Cut techniques. The Lift-and-Cut technique involves injecting fluid under the lesion to elevate it before excision, ensuring a clear margin for removal. Conversely, the Suck-and-Cut technique employs suction to lift the lesion before cutting it away, allowing for precise resection of mucosal tissues. Both methods aim to improve patient outcomes by effectively removing lesions while preserving surrounding healthy tissue.</p></p>
