<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Mapping Camera System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Linear Array Scanners (Pushbroom)</li><li>Systems based on Area Arrays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Digital Mapping Camera System market comprises two primary types: Linear Array Scanners (Pushbroom) and Area Array Systems. Linear Array Scanners capture images by moving the sensor linearly across the scene, providing high-resolution, continuous data ideal for wide-area mapping. In contrast, Area Array Systems use a grid of sensors to capture images simultaneously, making them suitable for detailed close-up mapping. Both technologies serve various applications in remote sensing, cartography, and geographical information systems, enhancing data collection efficiency and accuracy.</p></p>
