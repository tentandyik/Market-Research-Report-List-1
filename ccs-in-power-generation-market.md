<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CCS in Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Carbon Capture</li><li>Carbon Storage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in power generation refers to technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions produced from power plants, preventing them from entering the atmosphere. The market consists of two main segments: carbon capture, which involves capturing CO2 from exhaust gases; and carbon storage, which involves transporting and storing the captured CO2 underground in geological formations. This process is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change while enabling continued reliance on fossil fuels in energy production.</p></p>

<p><strong>The CCS in Power Generation Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-Combustion Capture</li><li>Post-Combustion Capture</li><li>Oxy-Fuel Combustion Capture</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in the power generation market involves three main applications: Pre-Combustion Capture, Post-Combustion Capture, and Oxy-Fuel Combustion Capture. Pre-Combustion Capture removes carbon dioxide before combustion by converting fossil fuels into hydrogen and CO2. Post-Combustion Capture extracts CO2 from exhaust gases after fuel has been burned, utilizing chemical solvents. Oxy-Fuel Combustion Capture involves burning fossil fuels in pure oxygen, resulting in a concentrated CO2 stream, making capture easier. Together, these methods aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p></p>
